# Ink to Insight â€“ Handwritten Document Digitization using OCR

**Ink to Insight** is a machine learning-powered system that converts handwritten documents into structured digital text and then generates meaningful summaries using both extractive and abstractive techniques. It leverages OCR, image processing, PyTorch models, and NLP libraries like SpaCy and Transformers to extract and refine insights from unstructured handwritten inputs.

## Key Features

- Image preprocessing using OpenCV and NumPy  
- OCR for handwritten text recognition  
- Text refinement using PyTorch-based machine learning models  
- Extractive summarization using SpaCy  
- Abstractive summarization using the T5 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library  
- Output generation as editable `.txt` and summarized files  

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.8+  
- **OCR & Image Processing:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Machine Learning Framework:** PyTorch, Scikit-learn  
- **Natural Language Processing:** SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers (T5 model)
